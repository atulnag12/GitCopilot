We will create a BrokerMonitoring service in the DEV2 NY environment, which will connect to a specific DEV2 Broker to test its handling of varying subscription loads. The service will simulate usage by creating subscriptions at different scales: 1000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and 2,000,000 subscriptions across multiple topics. The goal is to assess the broker's ability to handle large-scale subscriptions and track its performance using BAC (Broker Activity Count). During testing, we will focus on monitoring key metrics like subscription count, resource utilization, and response time to evaluate the brokerâ€™s performance under stress. This will help us identify potential capacity limitations, bottlenecks, or performance degradation as the subscription load increases. The findings from these tests will guide further optimization and scaling strategies, ensuring that the broker can manage high volumes of subscriptions and client connections effectively in a production environment.

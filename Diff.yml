The Pioneer application will integrate with OpenTelemetry and Dynatrace One Agent to continuously monitor and report its operational state. The application will capture and transmit key JVM metrics, including:

Memory usage (e.g., total memory and used memory),
CPU usage (e.g., CPU load and time spent),
Garbage collection statistics (e.g., frequency and duration of GC events),
And any other critical performance indicators necessary for overall system health.
These metrics will be reported in two ways:

Numeric Metrics: Quantitative values representing system performance, such as 90% memory usage or 70% CPU utilization.
Health State Indicators: A binary (0 or 1) representation of system health, where:
0 indicates that the system is in a healthy state (e.g., memory usage < 90%),
1 indicates that the system is in an unhealthy state (e.g., memory usage > 90%).
When the system detects an unhealthy state (e.g., high memory usage or CPU overuse), the Pioneer component will attempt a series of automated recovery actions, such as:

Reconnecting to the database,
Re-establishing connections with the Empire (or other critical services),
Reconnecting to external market systems or other necessary components.
These self-recovery mechanisms are designed to address common failure scenarios and restore the application to a healthy state without manual intervention.

However, if these automated recovery actions fail to resolve the issue, the Pioneer application will initiate a shutdown procedure, which serves as an alert to the system administrators. This shutdown will indicate that manual intervention is required to address the underlying problem and prevent further degradation of the service.

The goal is to improve system resilience by automatically handling transient failures and reducing downtime, while also ensuring that issues that cannot be automatically resolved are flagged for immediate human attention.
